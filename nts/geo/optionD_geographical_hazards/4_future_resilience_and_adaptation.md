- hazard - threat (whether natural or human) that has the potential to cause loss of life, injury, property damage, socio-economic disruption, or environmental degradation
- hazard event - occurrence (realization) of a hazard, the effects of which change demographic, economic and/or environmental conditions
- disaster - major hazard event that causes widespread disruption to a community or region, which the affected community is unable to deal with adequately without outside help
- Vulnerability - susceptibility of a community to a hazard or to the impacts of a hazard event
- Risk - probability of a hazard causing harmful consequences (expected losses in terms of deaths, injuries, property damage, economy and environment)

  To what extent is it possible to give vulnerable populations warning of an earthquake event?
  Introduction:

Earthquakes pose a hazard to residents near its occurrence as it oscillates the ground. This may result in deconstruction of buildings, breakage of pipes, utility wires, or transport infrastructure. This can result in colossal economic damages while it also threatens the physical lives of the affected. By notifying the vulnerable population about an earthquake event, the losses due to the natural hazard can be greatly reduced.

As earthquakes are caused by the movement of Earth's tectonic plates moved by the convectional currents of Earth's magma underneath the crust, the activities of the tectonic plates are important. This means that regions in the vicinity of a tectonic plate margin are likely to have an earthquake compared to regions without margins. By simply considering the region's availability of tectonic boundaries that lead to earthquakes, vulnerability of a population can be assessed at a large scale.

Next, monitoring the plate movements and seismic activities near the boundaries can give early signs that there would be a large earthquake affecting a population. Many nations including the US Geographical Survey or the Japanese government consistently monitor and publicize their data on the latest seismic activities. This ensures that scientists and researchers have access to data necessary to predict whether an earthquake can occur. One of the most useful information in predicting a large earthquake event is foreshocks. These shocks come slightly before a large movement of the plate boundary which allows for predictions that a large earthquake would come.

Previous recordings of earthquakes are also useful in predicting earthquakes. For example, there may be faults that are susceptible to earthquakes. By compiling past data and the frequency of the pre-occurred earthquakes, researches may be able to find the likeliness for a specific fault line to cause an earthquake.

The ability to notify the population also relies on a fast communication system to distribute the information. For example, in Los Angeles, the city government developed a mobile app that alerts its residents to take shelter through their mobile devices. As Earthquake's motion cannot travel faster than an electromagnetic signal, there is a small period between the warning and the shake depending on the location of the vulnerable individual. By implementing a streamlined information route to distribute the emergency information to the residents, the vulnerable population can be notified before an earthquake arrives to prepare.

Therefore, the extent to which a vulnerable population relies on whether there are prior research, monitoring, and streamlined information distribution mechanism to warn the individuals before large earthquake events.

def:
- adaptation - ways in which human activities/actions are altered to take into account the increasing risk of a hazard
- resilience - ability to protect lives, livelihoods and infrastructure from destruction, and to the ability recover after a hazard occurred
