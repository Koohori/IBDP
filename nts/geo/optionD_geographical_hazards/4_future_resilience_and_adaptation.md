def:

- hazard - threat (whether natural or human) that has the potential to cause loss of life, injury, property damage, socio-economic disruption, or environmental degradation
- hazard event - occurrence (realization) of a hazard, the effects of which change demographic, economic and/or environmental conditions
- disaster - major hazard event that causes widespread disruption to a community or region, which the affected community is unable to deal with adequately without outside help
- Vulnerability - susceptibility of a community to a hazard or to the impacts of a hazard event
- Risk - probability of a hazard causing harmful consequences (expected losses in terms of deaths, injuries, property damage, economy and environment)

Theories:
- continental drift theory - CDT
- convectional current theory - CCT
- sea floor spreading theory - SFST
- plate tectonics - PT
- polar wandering - similar to CDT

lahar - rocks with water, can be caused by volcanos and rain carrying debris
landslide - sliding, kind of like lahar
pyrocrasitc flows - gas moving down

- Future possibilities for lessening human vulnerability
- Geophysical harzard prevention
- pre-event
- post event adoptions
