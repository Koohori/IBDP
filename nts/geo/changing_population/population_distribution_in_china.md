# 1.1 How does population vary between places?
## Population Density
def:
* population distribution - spread of people across the world
population density - number of people living in a particular area, usually in 1 square kilometer

![population_Density](.src/population_density.png)

### Physical Factors
1. Relief and landforms
  * High population Density
    * lowland plains
    * flat river valleys
    * deltas
    * volcanic areas with fertile soil
  * Lower population density
    * Mountainous regions with low
2. Climates
3. Soil type and quality
4. Water supply
5. Vegetation
6. Raw materials, natural resources
7. Natural threats

### Human Factors
1. Agriculture
2. Secondary industry
3. Accessibility
4. Political decisions - government policy
5. Conflict - wars and conflicts

def.
* Crude birth rate - number of lives per 1,000 population in a given year (is not growth rate)
* Fertility rate - number of live births per 1,000 women aged 15-49 in a given year
* Total Fertility Rate - Average number of children that would be born to a woman by the time she ended childbearing if she were to pass through all her childbearing years conforming to the age-specific fertility rates of a given year
* Crude death rate - number of deaths per 1000 in a given year
* Infant mortality rate - number of infants who die in their first year per 1000 live births in a given time period (IMR = number of deaths below age 1 year / number of live births in the same year x 1000)
* Life expectancy - Average number of years a person can expect to live at the point of birth, assuming that existing conditions continue
  * Life expectancy is higher for women because:
    * difference in physiological make up
    * substance abuse rates - alcohol, nicotine
    * higher probability of unnatural deaths - violence

#### Fertility rates arround the world
![fertility_rates](.src/fertility_rates.png)

Factors affecting fertility rates
* Social/cultural Factors
  * expectations of families and women, education levels, religion
* political Factors
  * government policies (pro and anti natal policies)
* Economic Factors
  * Children viewed as assets in LIC, support from companies for working mothers in HICS
* Demographic factors
  * infant mortality rates

#### Mortality Rates
![mortality_rate](.src/mortality_rate.png)
Factors that affect mortality rates:
* Social/Cultural factors
  * education level of women
  * medical technology
    * availability of antibodies
    * AIDs drugs
    * immunization
* Political - government policies
  * Public health campaigns
* Economic Factors
  * Food and Nutrition
  * manufactured goods
* Demographic factors
  * age
  * diseases

  - Ethnic/religious persecution
  - war
  - forced labor
  - redevelopment

# 1.3 Population distribution and economic development, including voluntary internal migration & core-periphery patterns

##### Core periphery theory: world system concept by Immanuel Wallerstein
- core - areas that attract migration, hold power and much of the wealth
- periphery - places that are not reaping the benefits of globalization

- periphery - rural out-migration, attraction of core regions/mega cities
- Families and communities - 'chain' and 'relay' migration

![brandtline.png](.src/brandtline.png)

relative poverty - exists in all societies, regardless of the overall income level of the society
absolute poverty - lack of resources is life-threatening

### Case Study - China's Uneven Population Distribution

- Population - 1.37 billion people (2016)
- growth rate - 0.43% (2017 according to UN)
  - lower than the world average of 1.11%
- One Child Policy removed in 2016
- land area almost 9.6 million km sq
- Population density - 141 people per square kilometer
  - 79th in the world

#### Megacities in China
- Shanghai
- Beijing
- Chongqing
- Guizhou
- Shenzhen
- Chengdu
- Xian
- Wuhan
![population_density_map](.src/population_density_map.png)
Population is concentrated in Central East of China near the Coast
  - West of Korean Peninsula

#### Hu Huanyong line
def. Separates China in two parts - line drawn by hand by Mr. Hu
  - west of line has 64% of land but only 4% population
  - 96% of Chinese live on the east on 36 % of land

#### Physical Factors

![china_relief](.src/china_relief.png)
More plains and grass land near the coat of China including Fujian, Zhejiang, and Henan.

![china_anual](.src/china_anual.png)
- Tibet and Xinjiang have very low precipitation compared to the South of China with high precipitation
- North China with low precipitation has the highest annual air temperature range

#### Human Factors
- China was an imperial country until 1911
  - very rural
- Final emperor overthrown in 1911
  - republican government established
  - CCP (Chinese communist party) established in 1921
- China's economy subjected to series of 'Five Year Plans' & political/economic campaigns
- Great leap forward between 1958-1960
  - 45 million deaths
- Most economic growth focused on East
  - Estimated 700 million people out of poverty
- improved:
  - education
  - health care
  - electricity
  - running water
- Gap made between rich and poor parts of China
  - led to massive, often state sponsored migration to regional cities and from poorer to richer provinces

![economic_development_china](.src/economic_development_china.png)
People moved out to Eastern China to find better jobs and quality of life to shift the population distribution



|   | China | Niger|
|---|-----|----|
|Key Facts Location Place Names| Eastern China has majority of population citeis (Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen), Hu Line, 1.4 Billion people| Niamey (capital),Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Dosso (All cities central south), 24 million people, 80% land Sahara desert, 7 kids per woman, LIC, average life expectancy 55 (men)|
|Push and Pull, Employment| More job opportunities in Eastern cities such as Beijing, More hospitable than deserts located in West China | Higher precipitation in South, Southern cities are more industrialized with agriculture, cement, etc, has better transportation|
| Differences, Push and Pull Factors | Chinese industrialization policy (including Five Year Plans) | Less job opportunities
| Degree of challenge for citizens in rural areas | Less precipitation, higher temperatures | North is mostly desert and steppe (poor quality soil with severe/extreme weather)|

### Demographic Transition Model
![dtm](.src/dtm.png)
- Stage 1
  - Birth rate and death rate are both high
  - Population growth is slow and fluctuating
  - High Birth rate
    - lack of family planning
    - high infant mortality rate: putting babies in the 'bank'
    - Need for workers in agriculture
    - Religious beliefs
    - Children as economic assets
  - Dearth Rate is high:
    - High levels of disease
    - Famine
    - Lack of clean water
    - Lack of health care
    - War
    - Competition for food from predators (like rats)
    - lack of education
  - Typical Britain in the 18th century

  - Stage 2
    - Birth rate remains high
    - death rate falling
      - improved
        - healthcare
        - hygiene
        - sanitation
        - food production
        - transport for food
        - Infant Mortality Rate (decrease)
    - population begins to rise steadily
  - Stage 3
    - Birth rate starts to fall
      - family planning
      - low infant mortality
      - increased mechanization
      - increased standard of living
      - changing status of woman
    - Death Rate Continues to fall
    - Population rising
  - Stage 4
    - Birth rate and death rate both low
    - Population steady
      - increased education for woman
      - fertility rate decline
      - better medical technology
      - increasing life expectancy
  - Stage 5
    - Total population is high
      - starting to decline
    - birth rate falling
      - population no longer replacing itself
      - population is aging, will be dominated by elderly people
      - women are in workforce

![pyramid_stage](.src/pyramid_stage.png)

| Stage | Type of Pyramid | Age Structure|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Isosceles | Small population with a youthful profile due to low life expectancy |
| 2 | Isosceles with wider base and higher peak | Large numbers of young|
| 3 | Mid way between isosceles and stable pyramid, may exhibit straight flanks in younger cohorts | Large numbers of economically active and young, increasing number of elderly |
| 4 | Stable pyramid with straight sides | Zero population growth, optimum distribution|
| 5 | Constricted base with straight sides | aging population |

Dependent Ratio:
- def - ratio of those typically not in the labor force and those typically in the labor force
  - Simplistic calculation which is used across the world to understand societies and get a sense of potential pressures the economy may face in supporting an economically dependent population

- young dependent
  - population (0-15 yrs)
- Economically active
  - population (16-65yrs)
- Elderly dependent
  - population (above 65 yrs

Formula for dependency ratio:
(Number of children + Number of Pensioners) / (number of working age)

Child Dependency Ratio
- def. - ratio relates the number of children (0-14) to the working-age population (15-64 years old)
- Youth dependency ratio = (youth 0-14 )/(older population 15-64)

Old-age dependency ratio
- population 64 or above / population (15-64)
