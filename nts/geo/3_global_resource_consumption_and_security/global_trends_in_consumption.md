water scarcity
physical water capacity - water re


green water - rain
blue water - natural water sources
grey water - industrial used water
virtual water - water used to make something


three energy alternatives


| factor | Wind | Solar | Nuclear|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Advantage | Allows for all day generation, low cost/initial investment | sun is long term/  | reliable, cost effective |
| Disadvantage | Requires wind, certain places won't work | Sunlight does not reach everywhere | radioactive deposits and potential meltdowns, high initial investment |


Wood:
- still 2 billion ppl using it
- for heat and food in poor countries who can't have access to fossil fuels
- most distributed energy source in the world (because almost every nation has trees)

Oil:
- largest exporters Saudi Arabia, US, and Russia
- largest oil reserves in Russia, Venezuela, and Iran

Natural Gas:
- largest exporters US, Gazprom from Russia
- demand increasing due to china and India

Coal:
- Main country China
- second largest share of energy

hydrogen
- projected to be double digits share percentage in completely renewable energy time  

nexus - water, energy, food

24 hours consumption recycled:
- morning onigiri
- Lunch container for school lunch
- receipt

## Global Commons
- high seas
- Antarctica
- atmosphere
- out of space

- Tragedy of the commons
  - def:
  - Tragedy of the commons describes a situation in economic science when individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures or formal rules that govern access and use, act independently according to their own self interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated action

  Brazil paragraph problems
  - Brazil has a problem with its favelas and the greatest issue is social because its younger population is not getting sufficient education opportunities to break the cycle of social deprivation. This results in the continuous growth in the unskilled population which relies on the informal sector for economic support and does not result in progress for infrastructure such as housing. As the betterment of the favelas require that the newer generation to have a potential to break the cycle and join the formal sector with skilled jobs, the greatest problem of Rio de Janeiro is not being able to educate its youth in the favelas to reduce future issues that result from lack of education.


  neo - comination form meaning new, modified, used in the formation of compound words: neo - malthusian
  anti - against
  pessimist - negative
  optimist - postiive thinking

  Neo-Malthusian - Pessimist
  - South Africa: Drought leads to failed crops, water shortages
  - World is running of water and this maps shows where will dry up first
  Anti-Malthusian - optimist
  - we are getting smarter: we are technologically advanced and can create GM crops
  - we have inventive ways of making and sitributing

  Thomas Malthus:
    - 1700s
    - people would not stop increase in population
    - until it meets the food resrouces limit of Earth
      - upper bound
      - Malthusian limit

Paul Ehrlich:
- witnessed famines war and examples of issues over resources
- population control, an increase in food supply and redistribution of wealth are needed in order to address the worlds population problem
- most resources prices would increase over time in 1980s

Boserup:
- Looked at farming practices:
  - population growth causes agricultural growth
  - population size increases - population's ability to come up with new agricultural techniques so more food can be produced
  - shifting cultivation styles
  - multi-cropping systems - produces more than one harvest per year

  - based on idea that people knew the techniques then the population will have the knowledge to provide for the population

Optimum population
- number of people who, when working with all the available resources, will produce the highest per capita economic return. It is the highest standard of living and quality of life. If the size of the population increases or decreases from the optimum, the standard of living will fall

Underpopulation
- Occurs when there are far more resources in an area than can be used by people living there. Countries such as Canada can export their surplus food, energy and mineral resources  

Over population
- Occurs when there are too many people relative to the resources and technology locally available to maintain an adequate standard of living (eg. South Sudan, Somalia)

Carrying capacity
- Concept of a population ceiling is of a saturation level where population equals the carrying capacity of the local environment.
- Three models
  - 1
    - Population increase begins to taper off as the carrying capacity is approached and then to level off when the ceiling is reached
    - claimed that populations that are large in size, with long lives and low fertility rates
    - S-curve pattern
  - 2
    - Rapid rise in population overshoots the carrying capacity
    - resulting in a sudden check
    - famine, birth control to be initiated
    - J shaped
    -
  - 3
    - Rate of increase may be unchanged until the ceiling reached
    - Increase drops to zero at ceiling
    - highly unlikely situation


Green Revolution
- 1944: Rockefeller Foundation
  - High Yielding Varieties (HYV) used in Mexico and Asia because of rising population
- Mexico became exporter of grain rather than importer
- India went from 11m toms in 1970 to 55m tons in 1990
- created for rice, sugar cane and other staple crops



q:
1. what is difference bweteen technical vs biological nutrients
2. what are 3 economic benefits of circular economy
3. explain how the circular economy has environmental benefits
4. evaluate the biggest challenge for the circular economy for lic and hics:



physical factors:
- quality of housing
- level of pollution
- vandalism , graffiti
Social indicators:
- standard of education
- quality of housing
- incidence of crime
- lone parent families
Economic indices:
- access to employment, unemployment and underemployment, levels of income
Political indices:
- opportunities to vote and to take part in community organization



informal sector:
- ease of entry
- indigenous inputs predominate
- family property predominates
- small scale of activity
- labor intensive
- adopted technology
- skills from outside the school system
- unregulated and competitive market

Formal sector
- difficult entry
- overseas inputs
- corporate property
- large scale of activity
- capital intensive
- imported technology
- formally acquired skills
- protected markets, eg. tariffs, quotas, licensing


Dual economy consists of both formal and informal economy
