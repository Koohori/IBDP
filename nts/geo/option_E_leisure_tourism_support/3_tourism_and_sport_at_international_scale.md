def: 
- vertical integration - takes places when a tnc controls two or more stages of supply chain
- horizontal integration - tnc controls more than one compnay at the same stage of the supply chain

What is TNC?
- trans national coorporations

name three TNCs:
- Expedia, Priceline, Thomas Cook

TNC can offcer cheap tourism opportunities because they can take economies of scale to their advantge. They can lower per unit costs. 

Economies of scale means that as companies become larger, they can save money. 

Horizontal integration is owning separate companies in same stage of supply chain, vertical integration is owning different processes inside of the supply chain
