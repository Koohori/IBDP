3. urban system growth
4. urban deindustrialization

- Urban growth - an increase in the absolute size of an urban population
- urbanization -  population shift from rural to urban areas, the corresponding decrease in the proportion of people living in rural areas, and the ways in which societies adapt to this change
- centripetal movement - a movement of people towards a center and that includes both pull and push factors
- suburbanization - establishment of residential communities on the outskirts of a city
- counter-urbanization - when large numbers of people move from urban areas into surrounding countryside or rural areas
- decentralization - The movement of people from inner urban areas to areas beyond city limits
- re-urbanization - development of activities to increase residential population densities within the existing built‑up area of a city. This may include the redevelopment of vacant land, the refurbishment of housing and the development of new business enterprises
- sprawl - unplanned and uncontrolled physical expansion of an urban area into the surrounding countryside. It is closely linked to the process of suburbanization
- rural migration - movement of people from rural to urban areas
- urban migration - movement of people from urban to rural areas
- circular migration - temporary and usually repetitive movement of a migrant worker between home and host areas, typically for the purpose of employment
- post industrial cities - traditional industry maintains a significant but decreasing share of economic activity
- urban decline - deterioration of the inner city often caused by lack of investment and maintenance
- urban decay - sociological process by which a previously functioning city, or part of a city, falls into disrepair and decrepitude
- gentrification - process where wealthy, college-educated individuals begin to move into poor or working-class communities, often originally occupied by communities of color
- urban renewal -  economic development tool used by local governments across the country, More specifically, it is a method of economically revitalizing areas of “blight” through public investments that stimulate private development
- deindustrialization - reduction of industrial activity or capacity in a region or economy.

natural increase - when birth rate is higher than birth rate

- It is common in areas where there may be brownfield sites (abandoned, derelict or underused industrial buildings and land, which may be contaminated but has potential for redevelopment).
- Thus, as well as residential rehabilitation and upgrading, there is also commercial redevelopment.

 Gentrification may lead to:
- The social displacement of poor people: as an area becomes gentrified, house prices rise and the poor are unable to afford the increased prices
•As they move out, young, upwardly mobile populations take their place

social
* demographic change leading to residential segregation displacement of low income families
- social exclusion for original residents, lack of affordable housing, shop lease rents increased and service becomes too expensive
- location that was once deteriorating is now better off
- erosion of cultures formed by original residents- new residents moving in have their own way of viewing life

Political
- protests can result in vandalism and damage to the new and improved areas
- change in political views, land use and redevelopment pressures, from both the new and existing residents are high on the local government agenda
- local authorities often accused of being persuaded by developers and other parties with vested interests

economic
- real estate markets increased rent purchase prices, new development of luxury housing
- land use change, decreased secondary sector and lower end market shops, increase in tertiary sector

environmental
- improvement to the physical landscapes of the area with new green/open spaces


q: what evidence might you see that gentrification is taking place?
A: Gentrification may be taking place if new residential areas are being built in historically un-touched or non-residential areas. It would be more obvious if they are subsidized, large scale, and directed by governmental decision to push money into an area.



q: explain the positive and negative impacts of gentrification on area (4marks)
A: Positives include more housing and more investments into a region for developments such as housing. As investments lead to more infrastructures and attention from government authorities, it will house more people in the area and will likely increase the average quality of life in the area. However, previ1ously living residents may not have the stability that they desired.
