### Natural / Human changes occur to affect the global energy balance
- inputs
  - elements that go into a system
- outputs
  - whatever comes out of the system

The atmosphere is an open system, receiving radiation from both the sun and the earth. the energy of the earth is very small but it does have an effect in particular in urban climates. Incoming solar radiation is referred to as insolation.
The main energy that drives all of our weather systems and our climate comes from the sun. the vast majority of this energy is absorbed at the equator where as energy is generally lost in the polar regions. However, this energy is redistributed to higher latitudes by wind and air circulations.

- radiation - emission of short wave and long waves
  - sun is very hot body, most of its radiation is in the form of very short wavelengths such as ultraviolet and visible light
- convection - transfer of heat by the movement of gas or liquid
- conduction - transfer of heat by contact
- short wave - incoming solar radiation
  - insolation
  - amount of insolation received varies with angle of the sun and cloud type
  - main energy input varies according to altitude
  - visible in wavelengths not absorbed by earth's atmosphere
    - heats the earths from long wave radiation
- long wave - energy from earth into the atmosphere
  - cloudless night means large loss of long wave radiation from earth
  - lack of clouds - little return of long wave radiation from the atmosphere
    - net loss of energy from the surface
  - cloudy night - cloud returns long wave radiation to the surface reducing overall loss of energy
- albedo - fraction of sun's radiation from a surface
  - term has its origin from Latin word albus meaning 'white'

- Negative feedback - when a system acts by lessening the effect of the original change and ultimately reserving it
  - increase in one phenomenon
    - dampening of another phenomenon
  - ex.
    - increased evapotranspiration
    - higher precipitation
    - increased snowfall on polar ice caps
    - reduce mean global temperature
- Positive feedback - occurs within a system where a change causes a snowball effect, continuing or even accelerating the original change
  - increasing one phenomenon
  - ex. global warming
    - melting of polar ice
    - less ice and snow
    - lowers albedo
    - rocks or darker surfaces appear
    - less white surfaces that reflect heatx

- methane
  - chemical compound CH4
  - group 14 hydride
  - simplest alkane
  - mane constituent of natural gas
  - natural methane found below ground and sea

Biosphere - describes one of the four layers that surround the Earth along with:
  - lithosphere (rock)
  - Hydrosphere (water)
  - atmosphere (air)


  major
  - atmosphere
  - Hydrosphere
  - pedosphere
  - Biosphere
  - lithosphere
  - fossil fuels

carbon cycle describes where carbon is stored

- carbon added to atmosphere
  - volcanic eruptions
  - decomposition of plant material
  - removed from the atmosphere through plant growth and other means

carbon measured in unit peta-gram (Pg)

| Event | Geolocation | Environmental impacts | economic cost of damage | social |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Drought| California | Less water and fertility in soil | Less agricultural production , higher cost of water| water shortages and limits on the usage of water|
| Wild fire | Australia | Trees burning, loss of biodiversity | Cost approaching 100 Billion  | People had to move out of house / evacuation |
| Coastal flooding | New Orleans | washed away ecology | costing around 20 billion dollars | Residents need to move out and access insurance, loss of property |

how climate change imipacts
- transport routes
- migration
- tourism

|place | Tiny village in Alaska Inupiaq ppl|
|---| -- |
| Summary of impacts on climate change on transport routes / migration / tourism | whales can't be catched because thin ice mean that captains might be injured, less ice means not much to hunt, they are essentially homeless with multiple families living in three bedroom houses|
| Time scale | from 2004 when storms started |
|Scale - number of people impacted |small village and its residents |
|what is being caused, by this situation now | people are starting to leave the village to join major cities, loss of culture |

def.
- vulnerability to climate change - degree to which people are susceptible to, or unable to cope with negative impacts of climate change

most vulnerable:
- women and children

- adaptive capacity
  - can vary over time based on changing conditions and may differ in relation to particular hazards
  - determined by age, gender, education and perception of risk


disparities in exposure to climate change risk
- exposure to climate variation is primarily a function of geography
  - coastal communities have higher exposure to sea level rise & cyclones
- sensitivity
  - degree to which a given community or ecosystem is affected by climatic stresses
- adaptive capacity
  - ability of a system to adapt to climate change to moderate potential damages

coping with climate change example demographic:
- single father:
  - they might be concerned about the environment and if it stays in tact for the kid

#### inuit people in canada climate caused issues
  - infrastrucutre
    - damaged because permafrost melts
    - foundation has to be made again to restructure the building and that costs funds
  - special places
    - later freezing of the ice mean that there is more coastal erosion removing cultural cites of ppl living near coasts
  - energy
    - less warming
    - pipelines and fuel tanks might need new construction
    - hydroelectric generation may differ due to melting ice
    - permafrost makes unreliable infrastrucutre

  - culture
    - relies on hunting and fishing
    - elderly can't predict the weather anymore
    - some traditional routes can;t be used anymore
    - they are used to surviving in the cold so it changes culture
    - their ability to cope with climate change is limited by poverty and health care

  - tourism
    - longer summers means incresaed tourist activity
    - more marine torusim which may impact communities
    - accesssing prior ice locations with cruises
    - arts and crafts
      - lead to more sales of arts and crafts
      - milder weather acess to carving stones
      - may threaten stability of artists
  - health and diseases
    - diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans are expected to rise as temperatures warm
    - previously isolated animals may have contact with each other because the natural barriers have changed
    - unpredictable wetaher patterns cause more accitedent and emergency situations
    - search and rescue missions

  - resource development
    - increase in exploration and industrial activity result in reduced sea ice cover & warmer temperatures
    - potential for vast hydrocarbon depostis so oil and minerals can be exploited
    - fishing is important to culture but the fish would move upnorth when the temperature increases  

  - transportation
    - decreasing sea ice thickness means some areas become accessible
    - more shipping and industrial activities
    - risks the environment with spills and other pollutants
    - challenges snowmobile or dog team transportation routes
    - new routes needed
    - shifted and cracked airport runways
    - air travel neccessary for access
    - needs to improve research, monitoring and response capabilities
  - food security
    - shift from country food to more expensive,store bought, and often unhealthy food items
    - change inuit health
    - food storage affected by warmer temperatures
    - previously stored food due to cold can now spoil
    - country food still healthiest food for inuit ppl
    - shifting air and water currents can bring contaminants into arctic
    - permafrost mealting incresases mercurity levels in northern lakes
    - mercury affects in plants
