### Natural / Human changes occur to affect the global energy balance
- inputs
  - elements that go into a system
- outputs
  - whatever comes out of the system

The atmosphere is an open system, receiving radiation from both the sun and the earth. the energy of the earth is very small but it does have an effect in particular in urban climates. Incoming solar radiation is referred to as insolation.
The main energy that drives all of our weather systems and our climate comes from the sun. the vast majority of this energy is absorbed at the equator where as energy is generally lost in the polar regions. However, this energy is redistributed to higher latitudes by wind and air circulations.

- radiation - emission of short wave and long waves
  - sun is very hot body, most of its radiation is in the form of very short wavelengths such as ultraviolet and visible light
- convection - transfer of heat by the movement of gas or liquid
- conduction - transfer of heat by contact
- short wave - incoming solar radiation
  - insolation
  - amount of insolation received varies with angle of the sun and cloud type
  - main energy input varies according to altitude
  - visible in wavelengths not absorbed by earth's atmosphere
    - heats the earths from long wave radiation
- long wave - energy from earth into the atmosphere
  - cloudless night means large loss of long wave radiation from earth
  - lack of clouds - little return of long wave radiation from the atmosphere
    - net loss of energy from the surface
  - cloudy night - cloud returns long wave radiation to the surface reducing overall loss of energy
