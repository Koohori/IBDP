## Reflection on global issue with Antigone after reading one time
- Global Issue:
	- Power, politics and justice
	- Power of Creon to punish people under his own and sole discretion raises question about how the distribution of power is meant to be
	- Politics of allowing a king to be able to ditate the law of the land seems dangerous. 
	- Justice based on the eyes of Greek Gods. Also determined by Creon.
- Quotations:
	- Whether it is justice to bury or not bury the dead
		- 'Death does not make an enemy a friend'
		- 'Honouring the traitor, you dishonour him'
	- Absolute power of the ruler
		- 'Have caught her; I will kill her.'
		- And violates the law, or would dictate to those who rule. Lawful authority must be obeyed in all things great or small'
		- 'Villain! Do you oppose your father's will?'
	- What is supported by god?
		- 'Opposing God's, you disregard your own' - Haemon
		- 'Have I not always followed your good counsel?' - Creon
		- 'Therefore the gods arouse against you their sure avengers;* they lie in your path' - Teiresias
